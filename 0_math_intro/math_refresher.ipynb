    "## Complex Numbers\n",
    "A complex number is a nubwer written in the form $z = a + bi$ where $a$ is known as the \"real\" part and $bi$ is the \"imaginary part.  The imaginary unit $i$ is defined as $i = \\sqrt{-1}$.  Typically in electrical engineers use $i$ to represent current, so you will often see engineers use $j$ as a substitue for $i$ i.e) $j = i = \\sqrt{-1}$.  I'm an electrical engineer so I'm going to force you to use $j$ >:)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition\n",
    "Given two complex numbers $z_1 = a + bj$ and $z_2 = c + dj$, their sum and difference is found by adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts seperately:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_1 + z_2 = (a + c) + (b + d)j$$\n",
    "$$z_1 - z_2 = (a - c) + (b - d)j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication\n",
    "#### Scalar multiplication\n",
    "When multiplying a complex number $z = a + bj$ by a real number $\\lambda$ the scalar is multiplied to both real and imaginary parts:\n",
    "$$\\lambda z = \\lambda a + \\lambda b j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complex multiplication\n",
    "Given two complex numbers $z_1 = a + bj$ and $z_2 = c + dj$, the method for multiplication is using FOIL:\n",
    "$$z_1 z_2 = (a + bj)(c + dj) $$\n",
    "$$z_1 z_2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Division\n",
    "Given two complex numbers $z_1 = a + bj$ and $z_2 = c + dj$, division is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{a + bj}{c + dj}$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\left(\\frac{ac + bd}{c^2 + d^2}\\right) +  \\left(\\frac{bc - ad}{c^2 + d^2}\\right)j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse (reciprical)\n",
    "The inverse of a complex number $z = a + bj$  is denoted by $z^{-1}$:\n",
    "$$z^{-1} = \\frac{1}{a + bj}$$\n",
    "$$z^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{a}{a^2 + b^2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{b}{a^2 + b^2}\\right)j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conjugate\n",
    "The complex conjugate of a number $z = a + bj$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$z^{*} = a - bj$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will sometimes see conjugation denoted by $\\bar{z}$.  Geometrically speaking, conjugation is simply the reflection around the real axis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For any complex number $z$, an important product $z\\cdot z^*$ is:\n",
    "$$z\\cdot z^* = a^2 + b^2$$\n",
    "It's important to note that this quantity will always be real\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnitude   \n",
    "The magnitude of a complex number $z = a + bj$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$  \n",
    "Geometrically you can think of this as the distance from the origin to the coordinate represented by the complex number  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Argument  \n",
    "The argument of a complex number $z = a + bj$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$\\arg{z} = \\tan^{-1}{\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is referred to as the phase of a complex number.  Geometrically speaking, the phase of a complex number is the angle between the coordinate represented by the complex number and the real axis\n",
    "### Polar form\n",
    "Complex numbers are often represented in polar coordinates as:\n",
    "$$z = r(\\cos{\\theta} + j\\sin{\\theta})$$\n",
    "where $r$ = $|z|$ and $\\theta = \\arg{z}$.  You will often see this form denoted in a more compact form as $r\\angle \\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euler's formula\n",
    "Euler's formula defines the fundamental relationship between complex exponentials and triginometric functions.  Euler's formula states:\n",
    "$$e^{j\\theta} = \\cos{\\theta} + j\\sin{\\theta} $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask yourself what the usefulness of this is and its power comes when performing math operations between complex numbers.  Recall that $e^{a} \\cdot e^{b} = e^{a + b}$ and $\\frac{e^{a}}{e^{b}} = e^{a - b}$ which means if we want to multiply and divide complex numbers we don't have to do complicated math in rectangular coordinates and instead can just do addition/subtraction with exponent powers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How waves are represented as complex exponentials\n",
    "Waves are often represented as complex exponential form to make operations algebraicly simpler.  Let's define a wave travelling in the +x direction as:\n",
    "$$u(x, t) = A\\cos{\\omega t - k x}$$\n",
    "Where $\\omega$ is the angul frequency of the wave defined as $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ and $k$ is the wavenumber defined as $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$.  Using euler's formula we can rewrite this as:\n",
    "$$u(x, t) = Ae^{(\\omega t - k x)}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using this definition would give us an imaginary part of $\\text{Im}(u(x, t)) = A\\sin{(\\omega t - k x)}$.  However when working with real valued signals like the one above we will only use the real part. i.e) $\\text{Re}(u(x, t))$  \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: When we start dealing with propogating plane waves we will find that plane waves are solutions to the wave equation and will have a component travelling in the $\\pm$ x direction which will lead to us utilizing both the real and imaginary part"

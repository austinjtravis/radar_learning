    "## Complex Numbers\n",
    "A complex number is a nubwer written in the form $z = a + bi$ where $a$ is known as the \"real\" part and $bi$ is the \"imaginary part.  The imaginary unit $i$ is defined as $i = \\sqrt{-1}$.  Typically in electrical engineers use $i$ to represent current, so you will often see engineers use $j$ as a substitue for $i$ i.e) $j = i = \\sqrt{-1}$.  I'm an electrical engineer so I'm going to force you to use $j$ >:)\n",

    "You may ask yourself what the usefulness of this is and its power comes when performing math operations between complex numbers.  Recall that $e^{a} \\cdot e^{b} = e^{a + b}$ and $\\frac{e^{a}}{e^{b}} = e^{a - b}$ which means if we want to multiply and divide complex numbers we don't have to do complicated math in rectangular coordinates and instead can just do addition/subtraction with exponent powers.  \n",

    "## How waves are represented as complex exponentials\n",

    "$$u(x, t) = Ae^{(\\omega t - k x)}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using this definition would give us an imaginary part of $\\text{Im}(u(x, t)) = A\\sin{(\\omega t - k x)}$.  However when working with real valued signals like the one above we will only use the real part. i.e) $\\text{Re}(u(x, t))$  \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: When we start dealing with propogating plane waves we will find that plane waves are solutions to the wave equation and will have a component travelling in the $\\pm$ x direction which will lead to us utilizing both the real and imaginary part"

The reason for the division by two is because the time delay we measure is the time it takes for the wave to travel to the target, reflect off the scatterer, and come back to the radar.  Because of this the time delay we measure really corresponds to $2R$, hence the divide by two.  \n",

    "## Linear frequency modulation\n",
    "Rather than using a short rectangular pulse with a duration $T_{rect} = \\frac{1}{B}$, we instead spread the signalâ€™s frequency content over a longer duration $T$. One way of achieving this is *linear frequency modulation* (LFM), where the frequency of the pulse increases or decreases linearly over time. This is also know as a chirp waveform.\n",

    "This process has left us with a longer duration pulse that retains the bandwidth of the short rect. One helpful way of thinking of this process is that we have applied a linearly increasing phase delay to each frequency component of the short duration pulse we wanted. In order to recover a short duration pulse from our chirp signal, all we need to do is apply the opposite delay to the signal. This can be done via matched filtering.  \n",

    "The linear FM waveform is popular in radar systems because its large time-bandwidth product can provide good range resolution. However, the large bandwidth of this waveform makes digital matched filtering difficult because it requires expensive, high-quality analog-to-digital converters. Stretch processing, also known as deramping or dechirping, is an alternative to matched filtering. Stretch processing provides pulse compression by looking for the return within a predefined range interval of interest. Stretch processing occurs in the analog domain. Unlike matched filtering, stretch processing reduces the bandwidth requirement of subsequent processing.  This means that we matched filter in hardware instead of digitally.  \n",

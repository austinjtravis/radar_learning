    "Signals received by radars are often very weak in strength (on the order of micro volts), so to make math and understanding of relative signal strength a metric known as decibels (dB) is used (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel).  Decibel is a measurement of relative strength in the logarithmic scale and is not an absolute value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Decibels are computed in two different ways depending if you're working with power or voltage:\n",
    "$$\\text{Power (dB):} = 10\\log_{10}{\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}$$\n",
    "$$\\text{Voltage (dB):} = 20\\log_{10}{\\frac{V_2}{V_1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where decibals become very powerful is for example instead of saying a signal is 1,000,00 times stronger you can say a signal is 60 dB stronger.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key note!\n",
    "Since decibels operate in logarithmic scale remember:\n",
    " * addition in dB is equivalent to multiplication in linear scale!\n",
    " * subtraction in dB is equivalent to division in linear scale!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common examples are:\n",

    "$$S = \\frac{Power}{Area} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Transmitter\n",
    "We'll start by assuming that our antenna radiates energy isotropically which means that it radiates energy evenly in all directions.  Since it radiates a spherical wave evenly in all directions (recall the surface area of a sphere is $4\\pi r^2$) this leads to a power density of:\n",
    "$$S = \\frac{Power}{Area} = \\frac{P_t}{4\\pi R^2} $$\n",
    "Now, isotropic antennas are physically impossible, so our antenna will be focusing energy in a specific direction.  The amount of energy that the antenna is focusing the overall power $P_t$ by is denoted as gain $G$.  If we add that to our equation we see:\n",

    "This is the first part of the radar range equation which tells us the amount of incident power density at a target at a distance of $R$ away from the radar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Target\n",
    "The signal we transmit will hit an object then reflect back to the radar.  This means that the power density at the receiver will depend on how much the target reflects back and then the distance from the target back to the radar.  The reflected wave will be a spherically radiating wave with power density:\n",
    "$$S = \\frac{Power}{Area} = \\frac{\\sigma}{4\\pi R^2}$$\n",
    "the target RCS ($\\sigma$) denotes how reflective the object is and how strong the return will be to the radar.  RCS is a function of material and also incidence angle the wave hits the object.  This contribution to the range equation will denote how much power the radar sees at the receiver \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Receiver\n",
    "The final part is to define how well our receive antenna does at receiving the signal reflected from the target.  This is defined by the antenna's effective aperature which is defined as:\n",
    "$$A_e = \\frac{G\\lambda^2}{4\\pi}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Putting it all together\n",

    "## Max range \n",
    "A common consideration for radar systems is to determine the max range the radar can operate such that it receives a certain power for a given target.  To derive this we can set our desired received power to be $P_{d}$.  If we substitue $P_{d}$ for the received power in the radar range equation we get:\n",
    "$$P_d = \\frac{P_{t} G_{t} G_{r} \\sigma \\lambda^2}{(4\\pi)^3 R_{tx}^2R_{rx}^2}$$\n",
    "With this we will assume that the path to the target from the transmitter is the same distance as the path to the receiver and that the gain of the receive antenna is the same as the transmit antenna.  This leads to $G_r = G_t = G$ and $R_{tx} = R_{rx} = R$.  Substituting this in the equation above leads to:\n",
    "$$P_d = \\frac{P_{t} G^2 \\sigma \\lambda^2}{(4\\pi)^3 R^4} $$\n",

    "The goal of RCS calibration is to remove all system specifics from the received power such that after calibration you only measure the radar cross section term.  This is achieved by measuring the RCS of a known target to compute the calibration constant, then using that constant to calibrate all subsequent data.  This is important because when looking at data you want to observe and work with RCS only since that is a property of the material/object itself.  Without calibrating out the system there is no way to accurately standardize your data.  \n",

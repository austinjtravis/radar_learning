    "MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) is an angle of arrival (not beamforming) approach for estimating the angle of arrival of a signal.  The previous two techniques fell into the \"delay and sum\" category, but MUSIC is known as a subspace technique.  \n",
    "\n",
    "MUSIC assumes that you know the number of sources in your signal and will categorize $N$ signals as the sources and the others as noise.  How it achieves this is by performing an eigen decomposition on the estimated signal covariance matrix and grouping $N$ eigenvectors with the $N$ strongest eigenvalues as the signal subspace and the other remaining eigenvectors as noise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that the signals covariance matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ is computed by:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{R}_{s}\\mathbf{a}^{H}$$  \n",

    "This is a little too complicated so i'll just skip to the result:\n",

    "\n",
    "When a spatial vector is orthogonal to the noise subspace, the peaks of the pseudospectrum are infinite (remember dot product between two orthogonal vectors is 0). In practice, because there is noise, and because the true covariance matrix is estimated by the sampled covariance matrix, the arrival vectors are never exactly orthogonal to the noise subspace. The angles at which the MUSIC psuedo spectrum has finite peaks are the sources angle of arrival. Because the pseudospectrum can have more peaks than there are sources, the algorithm requires that you specify the number of sources, D, as a parameter. Then the algorithm picks the D largest peaks"

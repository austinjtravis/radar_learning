    "Rather than using a short rectangular pulse with a duration $T_{rect} = \\frac{1}{B}$, we instead spread the signalâ€™s frequency content over a longer duration $T$. One way of achieving this is *linear frequency modulation* (LFM), where the frequency of the pulse increases or decreases linearly over time. This is also know as a chirp waveform.\n",

One helpful way of thinking of this process is that we have applied a linearly increasing phase delay to each frequency component of the short duration pulse we wanted.

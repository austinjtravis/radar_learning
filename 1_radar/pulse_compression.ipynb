    "In radar systems, achieving fine range resolution and maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are critical objectives. Fine range resolution allows you to distinguish between targets that are in close proximity to each other, and high SNR allows you to distinguish between target signal and noise\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range Resolution\n",
    "As discussed previously, two targets can be *resolved* if the peaks of their return signals are separated in time. One simple way to achieve higher range resolution therefore is to send shorter duration signals. Why then is the formula for the range resolution of a radar a function of the bandwidth of the signal, and not the duration?\n",

Any signal that is narrow in time must be broad in spectrum, and any signal which is narrow in spectrum must be broad in time. This relationship for a gaussian pulse is shown below. This relationship is not just true for a gaussian, it was just chosen as the fourier transform of a gaussian is just another gaussian."

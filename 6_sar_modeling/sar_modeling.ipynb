    "In SAR we transmit a waveform $h(t)$ at a position $\\bm{p}_{tx}$ with our antenna pointed at a position on the ground $\\bm{p}_{aim}$.  We trasnmit the waveform at a time $t_{tx}$ at the aimpoint and receive the reflected wave at a time $\\tau_{rx}$ later.  Mathematically for a single pulse this can be represented as:\n",
    "$$x(t) =  \\sqrt{\\frac{P_{t} G^2 \\sigma \\lambda^2}{(4\\pi)^3 R_{tx}^2R_{rx}^2}}h(t-\\tau_{rx})$$\n",
    "where $h(t)$ is the transmitted waveform.  Recall that to achieve fine range resolution we used a chirp waveform which means we can rewrite this as:\n",

    "The last simplifaction is to define $R = |\\bm{p}_{tx} - \\bm{p}_{aim}|$ and write the time delay as:\n",
